# Interactly-Task-2-Submission  
**Interactly – BACKEND DEVELOPER – Coding Task - 2**  
  
**Task 1:** Create a Nodejs script to open any given website URL in a headless browser, scroll down, and record it as a video.  
  
**Solution:**  
   
**Puppeteer Screen Recording:**  
  
This project demonstrates how to use Puppeteer to record a screen session in a headless browser, scroll through a webpage, and save the recording as an output.mp4 file.  
  
**Getting Started:**  
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.  

**Prerequisites**  
Node.js installed on your machine  
Ensure that the dependencies (puppeteer and puppeteer-screen-recorder) are properly installed.  

**Installation:**  
Clone the repository to your local machine.  
git clone <repository_url>  
Install the dependencies.  
npm install  
  
**Usage:**
Update the URL in app.js to the desired webpage you want to record.  
Adjust the scroll speed or distance in the page.evaluate() function in app.js if needed.  
  
**Run the application:**
node app.js

After execution, check for the output.mp4 file in the project directory. This file will contain the recorded screen session.
